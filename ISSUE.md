Todo and Issues
================

Todo
----------------

>**Todo-001 [<u>Core/Stl/vector.h</u>]** Still have some functions to implement. (e.g. as earse() remove() find() ...).  

>**Todo-002 [<u>Framework</u>]** Considering not to have EntryPoint.h embedded inside Common.  

>**Todo-003 [<u>Core/Stl/type_traits.h</u>]** move some of the traits to the other file. (e.g. some of the size conduction and data relative to traits_pod.h)  

Issues
----------------

>**Issue-001 [<u>Framework</u>]** Still have so many platform relative problems.  Auto macro platform choose frontend is needed. (e.g. SG\_PLATFORM\_XXX)  

Considering
----------------

>**Consider-001 [<u>Framework</u>]** ~~Maybe we don't need allocator. Just have the memory allocation strategy is ok.~~
