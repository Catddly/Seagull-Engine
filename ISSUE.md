#Todo and Issues

##Todo

Todo-001 [Core/STL/vector.h] Still have some functions to implement. (e.g. as earse() remove() find() ...).  

Todo-002 [Framework] Considering not to have EntryPoint.h embedded inside Common.  

Todo-003 [Framework] Maybe we don't need allocator. Just have the memory allocation strategy is ok.

##Issues

Issue-001 [Framework] Still have so many platform relative problems.  Auto macro platform choose frontend is needed. (e.g. SG\_PLATFORM\_XXX)
